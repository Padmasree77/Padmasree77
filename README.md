Hi!ðŸ‘‹ I'm Padmasree

ðŸ‘€ My full name is Padmasree Paul. I have completed both my bachelor's and master's degrees from the Department of Geological Sciences at Jahangirnagar University, Bangladesh. My MS thesis concentrated on investigating the Provenance and Reservoir Quality of Begumganj structure.
I'm interested in researching sedimentary geochemistry, sediment dynamics, the influence of sediments on both conventional and unconventional reservoirs to refine energy resources, and advanced techniques in sequence stratigraphy and diagenesis.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning both clastic and carbonate sedimentology and influence of sediments in energy reservoirs.

ðŸ‘¯ I want to collaborate with domain experts in Sedimentology, Sequence Stratigraphy ,Petroleum Geology, Reservoir Characterization, and related fields.
