Hi!ðŸ‘‹ I'm Padmasree

ðŸ‘€ My full name is Padmasree Paul. I have completed both my bachelor's degree from the Department of Geological Sciences at Jahangirnagar University, Bangladesh.Currently, I'm pursuing my MS from the same deaprtment with a concentration on Sedimentology.

I'm interested in researching issues related to Sediment Dynamics, the influunce of sediments on both conventional and unconventional reservoirs to refine energy resources, and advanced techniques in sequence stratigraphy and diagenesis.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning both clastic and carbonate sedimentology and influence of sediments in energy reservoirs.

ðŸ‘¯ I want to collaborate with domain experts in Sedimentology, Sequence Stratigraphy ,Petroleum Geology, Reservoir Characterization, and related fields.
